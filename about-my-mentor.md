## About My Mentor

Mr. Adeleke, a Senior at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, is working towards a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, anticipated to graduate in 2025. At the CEAMLS AI Research Institute, he is involved in mentoring two initiatives: Trustworthy AI and CodeWiz, the latter of which I am participating in. He also coordinates the CodeBears camp. I am eager to benefit from his expertise and direction on this project.
