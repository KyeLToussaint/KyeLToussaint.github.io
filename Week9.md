This week, we focused on completing our final reports, meticulously reviewing various aspects of the project.
Additionally, we prepared and presented our final summer Google Slides, showcasing the culmination of our work and insights gained throughout the project. 
In our project, we delved into the study and implementation of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which are advanced educational technologies designed to provide personalized instruction and feedback to learners. 
These systems leverage artificial intelligence to adapt to individual student needs, offering tailored support that can enhance the learning experience. 
By researching and applying the latest advancements in ITS, we aimed to create a robust and effective tutoring system, and our final presentations highlighted the comprehensive work and contributions made over the summer.
