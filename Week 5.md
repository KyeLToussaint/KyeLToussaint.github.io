In week 5, we made good progress on our Figma design and implementation. 
We focused on improving the user interface and making sure our design was user-friendly and functional.
I also spent time researching intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and how to properly integrate them into our tutoring platform.
This included looking at best practices and learning from real-world examples.

We then presented our research and Figma slides to other groups and mentors. 
During the presentation, we explained the key parts of our design and how we planned to use ITS.
The feedback we received was very helpful and gave us new ideas to improve our project.
Overall, it was a productive week that moved us closer to our project goals.
