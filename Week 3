During week 3, we dedicated significant time to developing our six Figma pages, focusing on refining the design and ensuring a cohesive user experience. We utilized the prototype tool extensively, allowing us to navigate through the user interface and test various interactions. This hands-on approach helped us identify potential improvements and better understand the flow of the application.

In addition to our work on Figma, we also tackled our literature reviews. This part of the project was more demanding than I had anticipated. The process involved extensive research, critical analysis of existing literature, and synthesizing information from multiple sources. Despite the challenges, I persevered and managed to complete the work. This experience not only deepened my understanding of the subject matter but also honed my research and analytical skills, which will be invaluable in future projects.
