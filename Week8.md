This week, I worked on the pitch video for our projects using Doodly, an easy-to-use video creation software for making professional whiteboard animations without technical skills. 
It offers a drag-and-drop interface, customizable drawing paths, and a large library of assets. Users can add music, sound effects, and voiceovers, and export videos in full HD. 
Ideal for educators, marketers, and content creators, Doodly simplifies creating engaging explainer videos and educational content. 
Additionally, I created a simple quiz for Code-Wiz to enhance our training modules and improve user engagement.
