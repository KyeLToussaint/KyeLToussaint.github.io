This week, I worked on Convai AI and other AI robot models. Convai is a platform that creates intelligent, interactive NPCs for games using generative AI and large language models. These NPCs can engage in natural, dynamic conversations, understand and react to their environment, and perform complex actions based on player interactions. Key features include emotional intelligence, multi-language support, and seamless integration with game engines like Unreal Engine. Convai also offers tools for developers to manage costs and integrate user logins via Convai Connect. Working with Convai was challenging as I encountered multiple errors and had to install several packages. However, I succeeded in getting the AI robot to speak and have conversations with the user. Now, I'm trying to implement a feature where the robot can go over assigned lessons. The next step is to connect the backend system with Convai.
