In Week 6, we focused on improving our Figma slides to ensure we had a clear plan for our project. 
We worked on making the design elements look better, organizing the content more effectively, 
and making sure our ideas were clearly presented. We then presented our work to the other participants and mentors as a practice run for our midsummer presentation
This session was important because it helped us gather feedback and spot any areas that needed improvement. 
The feedback we received was very helpful and allowed us to make our presentation even better. 
This week was key in preparing us for the midsummer presentation and making sure we were ready to showcase our work confidently.
